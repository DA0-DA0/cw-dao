# CW20 Stake

[![docs.rs](https://img.shields.io/docsrs/cw20-stake?logo=docsdotrs)](https://docs.rs/cw20-stake/latest/cw20_stake/)

This is a basic implementation of a cw20 staking contract. Staked
tokens can be unbonded with a configurable unbonding period. Staked
balances can be queried at any arbitrary height by external contracts.
